			<h2>Exago BI</h2>
			<span class="work-type">Enterprise web app / platform</span>
		</div>
		<p class="item-description">
			I worked at Exago, Inc. for almost ten years, from when it was an eight-person company to acquisition. The company built
			and sold a web-based business intelligence product called Exago BI and competed with Tableau, Power BI, Logi Analytics, et al.
			Pictured below are two of Exago BI's report designers. The Advanced Report Designer (left) I rewrote from scratch as part
			of a company-wide initiative to overhaul the product's user interface. The ExpressView designer I wrote myself.

			<h2>Plugster</h2>
			<span class="work-type">iOS Native App</span>
		</div>
		<p class="item-description">
			Plugster is an iOS native app I developed as a side project to help electric vehicle owners know where to charge. This was driven
			by a real use-case I had where EV charging was limited near my place of work, and I would often arrive at one of the nearby
			chargers to find all plugs already in use. The app allowed users to view charging stations on a map, and to add favorite
			charging stations allowing for availability alerts, and geofenced push notifications to help the user choose which station
			to navigate to when entering a certain area. Plug availability was sourced from several sources, including an (at the time) new
			API from Tom Tom, and scraping public information from first-party sources like ChargePoint and Greenlots.

			<h2>Kiku</h2>
			<span class="work-type">Mobile/Desktop PWA</span>
		</div>
		<p class="item-description">
			Kiku is a personal music library hosting service and player app that I use every day. I built this for myself after Google Play Music, which I was
			using to host my personal music library, was discontinued. This started as a simple web page that would shuffle my music collection
			which I put in Amazon S3, and over time became a web app for managing my music library, and a mobile PWA for consumption on a mobile
			device. This project uses a NodeJS backend, MySQL, and has a lot of interesting hidden complexity. Audio is encoded to multiple
			quality levels asynchronously on upload, so the user can choose at which bitrate to stream. If multiple users upload the same audio,
			the audio is de-duped, but each user can still layer their own metadata on top. Tracks can be downloaded to the device for offline
			playback. The app is multi-tenant, but so far I've only been using it for myself. :)

			<h2>Astr</h2>
			<span class="work-type">JavaScript Library</span>
			<a class="work-link" href="https://github.com/fernap3/astr" target="_blank">GitHub</a>
		</div>
		<p class="item-description">
			Astr is a JavaScript test runner that I built during my time at Exago to allow us to easily run tests in either a NodeJS
			environment, or in Chromium depending on the requirements of the test.  At the time we were using a tool called Chutzpah
			to run our JavaScript unit tests in a browser environment, but this tool used an outdated version of Webkit and it was
			important for us to test in up-to-date versions of Chromium. So I built this library to run tests in Chromium using
			Puppeteer. Astr was integrated into our CI pipeline where it was used daily.

			<h2>node-mysql wrapper</h2>
			<span class="work-type">JavaScript Library</span>
			<a class="work-link" href="https://github.com/fernap3/node-mysql" target="_blank">GitHub</a>
		</div>
		<p class="item-description">
			This is a simple library I built for use in my personal projects. It puts a small wrapper around the popular node-mysql
			NPM package, allowing one to use JavaScript template literal syntax to build parameterized SQL queries. So a call like this:<br> 
			<code>doQuery(`SELECT col FROM table WHERE id=?`, [userId])</code><br>
			can instead look like this:<br>
			<code>doQuery(`SELECT col FROM table WHERE id=${userId}`)</code>.
